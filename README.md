EMPLOYEE PROMOTION PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
1.INTRODUCTION

Overview
Promotion or career advancement is a process through which an employee of a
company is given a higher share of duties, a higher pay scale, or both. Promotion is not
just beneficial for employees but is also highly crucial for the employer or business
owners. It boosts the morale of promoted employees, increases their productivity, and
hence improves upon the overall profits earned by the organization.

Proposed System
The client is facing a problem in identifying the right people for promotion. The company
needs help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they
can expedite the entire promotion cycle. This problem can be solved by building a
machine learning that automates the process of promoting an employee. we make use
of employee datasets to build different classification ML models such as Decision tree,
Random forest, KNN, and xgboost. The best model is selected and saved for integration
with the flask application.
For better training results we make use of IBM to train the model to deploy the model on
IBM.

2.LITERATURE SURVEY
2.1Existing Problem
In [1], computer scientist was once quoted as spoken language,“You remove our prime twenty workers and that we [Microsoft] become a mediocre company”. 
This statement by computer scientist took our attention to 1 of the main issues of worker attrition at workplaces. worker attrition (turnover) causes a 
major price to any organization which can afterward impact its overall potency. As per CompData Surveys, over the past 5 years, total turnover has 
accumulated from fifteen.1 p.c to one8.5 percent. For any organization, finding a well trained and experienced worker may be a complicated task, however
it's even additional complicated to interchange such workers. This not solely will increase the many Human Resource (HR) price, however additionally impacts
the market price of a corporation. Despite these facts and ground reality, there's very little attention to the literature, that has been seeded to several 
misconceptions between time unit and workers. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to supply a framework for predicting the worker churn by analyzing the 
employee’s precise behaviors and attributes mistreatment classification techniques.

Pre-Requisites
In order to develop this project we need to install the following
software/packages:
Step 1: Anaconda Navigator
Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R
programming languages for data science and machine learning-related applications. It
can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.Conda is an open-source, cross-platform,
package management system. Anaconda comes with great tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter
Notebook, QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code.
For this project, we will be using a Jupyter notebook and Spyder
To install the Anaconda navigator and to know how to use Jupyter Notebook & Spyder
using Anaconda watch the video
Step 2: Python packages
To build Machine learning models you must require the following packages
● Sklearn: Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised
learning algorithms.
● NumPy: NumPy is a Python package that stands for 'Numerical Python. It is the core library
for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array of object
● Pandas: pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and
manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
● Matplotlib: It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using
general-purpose GUI toolkits
Step 3: Flask - Web framework used for building Web applications.
Watch the video below to learn how to install packages.
If you are using anaconda navigator, follow the below steps to download the required
packages:
Open anaconda prompt as administrator
● Type “pip install numpy ” and click enter
● Type “pip install pandas ” and click enter
● Type “pip install scikit-learn” and click enter.
● Type ”pip install matplotlib” and click enter.
● Type ”pip install scipy" and click enter.
● Type ”pip install pickle-mixin” and click enter.
● Type ”pip install seaborn” and click enter.
● Type “pip install Flask ” and click enter.
If you are using Pycharm IDE, you can install the packages through the command prompt
and follow the same syntax as above.

7. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
Advantages
• Efficient program for Employee promotion prediction
• Accurate output is produced
• Will predict Employee promotion with extreme accuracy
• Relatively inexpensive and fast
Disadvantages
• It will work in all condition but some condition it may not give
correct output

8. APPLICATION
• Employee information

9. CONCLUSION
Promotions have a favorable, significant and beneficial impact on employee work
performance in human resources process. In this study a prediction model for
employee promotion is proposed by using RF method.



10. FUTURE SCOPE
This program allows users to predict if the Employee is promoted or not. By
the help of this prediction, we can use this program and we can ensure that
the is promoted or not. It helps reduce the stress on user identifying
important promoted employee easily.
